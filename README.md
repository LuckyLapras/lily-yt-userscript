# hi i hate change so i did this thing

youtube changed how the sub box looks. i can't find an old screenshot of it so u'll just have to take my word for it. anyway it's ugly and big now

![screenshot](/images/bad_layout.png)

using [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/141ts0q/comment/jn6osk2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) i've put together a lil userscript that will make the sub box look like this (much better)

## how to install?

1. install userscript manager of choice (i use [tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) and thus i know these instructions will work with tampermonkey but im sure this choice is irrelevant)
2. click the `.user.js` file
3. click `Raw`
4. click `install`

u can see these instructions as an (old) video [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q102) in case u don't like me being dumb :3

## future plans (just so i don't forget)

- scale thumbnail sizes according to window size
- idfk whatever else people ask me to do

feel free to help with this if u want if not idc
